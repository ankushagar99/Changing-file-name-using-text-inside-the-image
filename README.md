# Changing-file-name-using-text-inside-the-image

This code uses easyocr and tkinter which takes all the images inside a folder.
I made this for a company which had alot of images and every image had a code inside it.
My task was to take the code from the image and rename the file name with it's code that inside it.

To use it..
Run
select the folder which has images and it will start doing it's process
it will take only 3 types of file which is .jpg, jpeg, and .png. you don't have to worry if there is different type of file
it will skip it and contine doing it's work.
If you have a graphic card with cuda driver then process will be fast.

Thank you
